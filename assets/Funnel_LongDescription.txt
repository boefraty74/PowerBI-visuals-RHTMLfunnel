Sometimes we tend to find wrong patterns in statistical noise and make wrong conclusions. 
 
Funnel plot helps you to compare samples and to find true ouliers among the measurements with varying precision. It is widely used for comparing institutional performance and medical data analysis. 
In our particular case, the measurements are rates of certain events (such as births) in populations (such as countries) of given size.     
This visual uses a fixed effect model estimator. You can control the visual attributes to suit your needs.     

NEW: support for tooltips on hover and selection

Here is how it works: 
[#LI] Define two required fields to be analyzed in plot (occurence and population fields) [/#LI]
[#LI] Optionally, provide the fields to be shown in tooltips on hover [/#LI]
[#LI] You may select Y axis to present percentage or ratio [/#LI]
[#LI] Use numerous formatting controls to refine the visual apperance of the plot [/#LI]
[#LI] The "funnel" is formed by confidence limits and show the amount of expected variation. The dots outside the funnel are outliers. [/#LI]
